## What are we going to create?
A smart application that can assist gardeners and farmers in tracking the health and ripeness status of plants with the help of a smarcar that provides a camera feed of the greenhouse/garden.

## Why are we creating this?
Users need to have an efficient way of knowing the status of their crops. The application will allow the user to quickly identify which plants require extra attention for reasons such as being ready for harvest or being ill. Users will have a good overview of plants they have marked as healthy and know that no further action is needed for these plants. The information will be on an individual plant level to minimize potential food waste from crops dying or spoiling. 

With the help of the data gathered it is possible for the user to ascertain that some parts of their greenhouse might need looking into, several ill plants in the same area might point to irrigation or lights not working properly for example.


## How are we creating this?
The user will drive a smart car around their farm/greenhouse with the help of an application where pots have already been marked with QR to identify them. The car has the capability to take photos of the plants with QR codes, decode it into a number and thus know which plant the car is looking at.

The user will then be able to update the plant's status in the app. When the user has finished updating the desired plants he/she can visit the info screen and get a table containing all the information about the plants. This includes plant ID, plant health status, plant type, row and column where it is located.
