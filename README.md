## What are we going to create?
A smart application that can assist gardeners and farmers in tracking the health and ripeness status of plants with the help of a smarcar that provides a camera feed of the greenhouse/garden.

## Why are we creating this?
Users need to have an efficient way of knowing the status of their crops. The application will allow the user to quickly identify which plants require extra attention for reasons such as being ready for harvest or being ill. Users will have a good overview of plants they have marked as healthy and know that no further action is needed for these plants. The information on plants will be on an individual level to minimise potential food waste from crops dying or spoiling.
With the help of the data gathered it is possible for the user to ascertain that some parts of their greenhouse might need looking into, several ill plants in the same area might point to irrigation or lights not working properly for example. 


## How are we creating this?
The user will drive a smart car around their farm/greenhouse with the help of an application where pots have already been marked with QR/barcodes to identify them. The car has the capability to take photos and send them back to a base station with more capable hardware.

This base station will process the image and identify the specific plant with its unique code. The user will then be able to update the plant's status in the app.
When the user has finished updating the desired plants he/she should be able to have an updated overview of the status of their plants in the application.
The database entries connected to the QR codes will contain information for that unique plant, such things at where it is located, its type and its health.
